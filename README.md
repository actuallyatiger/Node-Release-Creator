## About

The first time I opened a package.json, I saw the version field and instantly thought "Why not sync that with GitHub?" And well, that's exactly what I'm doing.

This action creates a new release every time you change the version in your package.json file. If you don't change the version in the file, it'll update the release on GitHub to the newest commit.
